# OBS Question Browser Dock

This is a simple HTML page meant to be used with OBS to provide questions to be used as topics of conversation.

Myself, and many other streamers, often find ourselves struggling to figure out topics of conversation while streaming. To alleviate this, I created a simple page that can be added directly to OBS as a browser dock and display questions that update about every minute (or can be refreshed manually).
